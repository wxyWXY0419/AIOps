To solve each given issue, you should iteratively instruct an Executor to write and execute Python code for data analysis on telemetry files of target system. By analyzing the execution results, you should approximate the answer step-by-step.\n\nThere is some domain knowledge for you:\n\n## TELEMETRY DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:\n\n- You can access the telemetry directory in our microservices system: `dataset/Bank/telemetry/`.\n\n- This directory contains subdirectories organized by a date (e.g., `dataset/Bank/telemetry/2021_03_05/`). \n\n- Within each date-specific directory, you’ll find these subdirectories: `metric`, `trace`, and `log` (e.g., `dataset/Bank/telemetry/2021_03_05/metric/`).\n\n- The telemetry data in those subdirectories is stored in CSV format (e.g., `dataset/Bank/telemetry/2021_03_05/metric/metric_container.csv`).\n\n## DATA SCHEMA\n\n1.  **Metric Files**:\n    \n    1. `metric_app.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,rr,sr,cnt,mrt,tc\n        1614787440,100.0,100.0,22,53.27,ServiceTest1\n        ```\n\n    2. `metric_container.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,kpi_name,value\n        1614787200,Tomcat04,OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUCpuUtil,26.2957\n        ```\n\n2.  **Trace Files**:\n\n    1. `trace_span.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,parent_id,span_id,trace_id,duration\n        1614787199628,dockerA2,369-bcou-dle-way1-c514cf30-43410@0824-2f0e47a816-17492,21030300016145905763,gw0120210304000517192504,19\n        ```\n\n3.  **Log Files**:\n\n    1. `log_service.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        log_id,timestamp,cmdb_id,log_name,value\n        8c7f5908ed126abdd0de6dbdd739715c,1614787201,Tomcat01,gc,\"3748789.580: [GC (CMS Initial Mark) [1 CMS-initial-mark: 2462269K(3145728K)] 3160896K(4089472K), 0.1985754 secs] [Times: user=0.59 sys=0.00, real=0.20 secs] \"\n        ```\n\n## POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE REASONS:\n        \n- high CPU usage\n- high memory usage \n- network latency \n- network packet loss\n- high disk I/O read usage \n- high disk space usage\n- high JVM CPU load \n- JVM Out of Memory (OOM) Heap\n\n## POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE COMPONENTS:\n\n- apache01\n- apache02\n- Tomcat01\n- Tomcat02\n- Tomcat04\n- Tomcat03\n- MG01\n- MG02\n- IG01\n- IG02\n- Mysql01\n- Mysql02\n- Redis01\n- Redis02\n\n## CLARIFICATION OF TELEMETRY DATA:\n\n1. This microservice system is a banking platform.\n\n2. The `metric_app.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, cnt, and mrt,. In contrast, `metric_container.csv` records a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1614787440).\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1614787199628).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1614787201).\n\n4. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by 'component-KPI' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where 'global' means the threshold of all 'component-KPI' time series within a whole metric file) for each 'component-KPI' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level's components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A 'fault' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it’s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified 'fault' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn't specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component's one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component's name, KPI's name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor's retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated 'component-KPI' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day's KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component's each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated 'component-KPI' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nDuring the specified time range of March 6, 2021, from 06:00 to 06:30, there was a single failure in the system. The component responsible for this failure and the reason behind it remain unknown. Please determine the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step. In each step, your response should follow the JSON format below:\n\n{\n    \"analysis\": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of 'what have been done' and 'what can be derived'. Respond 'None' if it is the first step.),\n    \"completed\": (\"True\" if you believe the issue is resolved, and an answer can be derived in the 'instruction' field.

DO contain the JSON object with the brackets \"{}\" only.

Notable findings include:\n\n1. **MySQL-Related Bottlenecks** (Mysql02)\n   - High disk I/O: Multiple disk-write related KPIs (\"Innodb pages written\", \"Innodb dblwr writes\", \"Innodb data written\") indicate heavy disk activity potentially causing latency.\n   - Memory pressure: Both \"MEMFreeMem\" and \"NoCacheMemPerc\" suggest abnormal memory usage patterns.\n   - High query processing load: \"Sort Range\", \"Handler Read Rnd\", and \"Handler Read Next\" KPIs show elevated database operations.\n\n2. **Redis Resource Saturation** (Redis01 & Redis02)\n   - CPU starvation: Elevated \"CPU-#_SingleCpuUtil\" and \"CPU-#_CPUWio\" suggest CPU bottlenecks affecting Redis nodes.\n   - Memory fragmentation (Redis02) and high resident set size (Redis01) indicate potential memory allocation issues.\n\n3. **Web Server Resource Strains** (Apache/Tomcat Instances)\n   - Apache servers (apache01/apache02): High CPU utilization during this window, particularly in system/user mode and disk I/O (\"DSKTps\", \"DSKWrite\").\n   - Tomcat nodes (Tomcat01/Tomcat02): Memory constraints (\"MEMFreeMem\", \"NoCacheMemPerc\") and CPU utilization patterns suggest resource starvation.\n\n4. **General Infrastructure Issues**\n   - MG02 and IG01/IG02 components show memory pressure and disk I/O issues across their specific KPIs.\n\nThese anomalies represent sustained resource utilization exceeding 95th percentile thresholds, with consecutive data points indicating persistent issues rather than transient spikes. The most critical findings (Mysql02 disk I/O and memory issues, Redis CPU/memory problems) would likely create cascading failures affecting the entire banking platform during this window.\n\nThe original code execution output of IPython Kernel is also provided below for reference:\n\nComponent                                                KPI\n0   apache01    OSLinux-OSLinux_LOCALDISK_LOCALDISK-sda_DSKWTps\n1    Redis01                             OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUWio\n2    Mysql02              Mysql-MySQL_3306_Innodb pages written\n3   Tomcat01           OSLinux-OSLinux_MEMORY_MEMORY_MEMFreeMem\n4    Redis02  redis-Redis_6379_Redis  (mem_fragmentation_ratio)\n5    Mysql01     OSLinux-OSLinux_LOCALDISK_LOCALDISK-sdb_DSKBps\n6    Mysql02                        Mysql-MySQL_3306_Sort Range\n7   apache02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-3_SingleCpuidle\n8       MG02       OSLinux-OSLinux_MEMORY_MEMORY_NoCacheMemPerc\n9    Mysql02                  Mysql-MySQL_3306_Handler Read Rnd\n10   Redis02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-2_SingleCpuidle\n11  apache01   OSLinux-OSLinux_LOCALDISK_LOCALDISK-sda_DSKWrite\n12   Redis01          redis-Redis_6379_Redis  (used_memory_rss)\n13   Mysql02        Mysql-MySQL_3306_Innodb dblwr pages written\n14  apache02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-0_SingleCpuidle\n15  Tomcat03                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-3_SingleCpuidle\n16   Mysql02               Mysql-MySQL_3306_Innodb data written\n17   Mysql01                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-3_SingleCpuidle\n18   Mysql02           OSLinux-OSLinux_MEMORY_MEMORY_MEMFreeMem\n19  apache01                         OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUSysTime\n20   Mysql02               Mysql-MySQL_3306_Innodb dblwr writes\n21  Tomcat02                        OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUidleutil\n22  Tomcat02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-2_SingleCpuidle\n23   Mysql02           Mysql-MySQL_3306_Table open cache misses\n24  apache01     OSLinux-OSLinux_LOCALDISK_LOCALDISK-sda_DSKTps\n25      IG01    OSLinux-OSLinux_LOCALDISK_LOCALDISK-sda_DSKWTps\n26  Tomcat01       OSLinux-OSLinux_MEMORY_MEMORY_NoCacheMemPerc\n27   Redis01  redis-Redis_6379_Redis  (mem_fragmentation_ratio)\n28      IG01                             OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUWio\n29  Tomcat03                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-1_SingleCpuidle\n30  apache02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-1_SingleCpuUtil\n31      IG02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-2_SingleCpuUtil\n32   Mysql02                    Mysql-MySQL_3306_ThreadsRunning\n33      IG02                    OSLinux-CPU_CPU-0_SingleCpuidle\n34  Tomcat02                             OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUWio\n35  apache01                        OSLinux-CPU_CPU_CPUUserTime\n36   Mysql02                 Mysql-MySQL_3306_Handler Read Next\n37      IG02           JVM-Threads_7778_JVM_ThreadCount_Threads\n38      MG01           OSLinux-OSLinux_MEMORY_MEMORY_MEMFreeMem\n39   Mysql02                     Mysql-MySQL_3306_Opened Tables\n40      MG01          JVM-Memory_7779_JVM_Memory_HeapMemoryUsed\n41   Mysql02  Mysql-MySQL_3306_Innodb buffer pool pages flushed\n42   Mysql02       OSLinux-OSLinux_MEMORY_MEMORY_NoCacheMemPerc"

According to Rule 1.4 (fourth bullet), when multiple node-level faulty components exist with a single failure, the component with the most severe/most numerous faults becomes the root cause.

The component responsible for this failure and the reason behind it remain unknown. Please determine the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nPlease first review your previous reasoning process to infer an exact answer of the issue. Then, summarize your final answer of the root causes using the following JSON format at the end of your response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"1\": {\n        \"root cause occurrence datetime\": (if asked by the issue, format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', otherwise ommited),\n        \"root cause component\": (if asked by the issue, one selected from the possible root cause component list, otherwise ommited),\n        \"root cause reason\": (if asked by the issue, one selected from the possible root cause reason list, otherwise ommited),\n    }, (mandatory)\n    \"2\": {\n        \"root cause occurrence datetime\": (if asked by the issue, format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', otherwise ommited),\n        \"root cause component\": (if asked by the issue, one selected from the possible root cause component list, otherwise ommited),\n        \"root cause reason\": (if asked by the issue, one selected from the possible root cause reason list, otherwise ommited),\n    }, (only if the failure number is \"unknown\" or \"more than one\" in the issue)\n    ... (only if the failure number is \"unknown\" or \"more than one\" in the issue)\n}\n```\n(Please use \"```json\" and \"```\" tags to wrap the JSON object. You only need to provide the elements asked by the issue, and ommited the other fields in the JSON.)\nNote that all the root cause components and reasons must be selected from the provided candidates. Do not reply 'unknown' or 'null' or 'not found' in the JSON. Do not be too conservative in selecting the root cause components and reasons. Be decisive to infer a possible answer based on your current observation."
